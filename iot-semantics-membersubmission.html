  <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
  <div>

<p>
This document presents an approach that enables end users to configure devices in their smart environments in a goal-driven way. Based on a user's desired goal state of his environment, a reasoning engine that has access to functional semantic metadata of services in the user's environment can infer whether or not it is possible to reach that goal, and outputs the REST requests that are necessary to do so. In contrast to process-driven systems where service mashups are statically defined, this approach makes use of embedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups that fulfill the user's goal. The main advantage of the presented system is its high degree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamic environments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual services becoming unavailable.

<hr><h1 id="intro">1. Introduction</h1>
<font color="red"><p>Story: We need to describe individual service offerings for composing higher-level application that involve heterogeneous WoT devices</p></font>

<p>
In environments that are populated by many heterogeneous smart things that can modify the users' environment (e.g., smart thermostats) or provide relevant contextual information (e.g., motion sensors), it is difficult for users to find and utilize services that provide the functionality they require. This is especially true when considering more complex user requirements that involve multiple cooperating devices within so-called physical mashups: composite applications that involve sensing or actuation of the physical world. Enabling owners of smart homes to create such mashups has been identified as an important domain in the field of ubiquitous computing research, and the easy configuration of smart environments is also gaining importance in the context of industrial automation in smart factories.
</p>

<p>
In this document, we discuss a novel method to facilitate the composition of heterogeneous services in Web of Things environments. We propose a <em>goal-driven</em> approach, meaning that we ask users to state which properties their smart environment should have (e.g., regarding their personal comfort, such as setting the ambient temperature). Given this statement of a user's goal, the discussed system determines whether the goal can be reached given the set of available services, and also infers which user actions (i.e., REST requests in this case) are necessary to reach it. The user can then execute these requests and thereby modify his environment to reach the desired goal. Because service mashups are created at runtime from user goals, this approach can handle highly dynamic service environments.
</p>

<p>
To find out whether the system can provide a mashup that achieves the user's goal, we require a way of determining what functionality the individual services provide and how to use them. To enable this, we suggest to combine semantic information about <em>what functionality</em> a device provides with a description of its REST program interface (i.e., of <em>how</em> it can be invoked by clients) and expose this data using metadata documents that are linked to the service URIs. We thus explicitly target semantic descriptions of the <em>functionality of devices</em>. We view such functional descriptions as distinct from describing <em>device properties</em> - a few other projects target that aspect, most prominently the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/ssn/ssnx/ssn">Semantic Sensor Network Ontology</a>. From our perspective, descriptions of device properties on the one hand and of their functionality on the other could complement each other when planning execution paths in smart environments: the purely functional planning could be covered by descriptions as discussed in this document, while the selection of devices according to non-functional aspects (e.g., what precision is required when dealing with a sensor) could be done using device property descriptions.
</p>

<hr><h1 id="servicedescriptions">2. Functional Service Descriptions for WoT Devices</h1>
<font color="red"><p>Story: From service descriptions to WoT</p></font>

In this section, we first briefly introduce RESTdesc, an approach to functionally describing REST services. Next, we discuss how this can be applied for describing device functions in Web of Things scenarios. For illustrative purposes, the example code shown in this section uses HTTP requests &mdash; however, our approach can also be applied to constrained devices that use the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252">Constrained Application Protocol</a> (CoAP; see <a href="#coap">Section 3</a> of this document).


<h2 id="restsemantics">2.1 Functional Descriptions for REST Services</h2><div>
<font color="red"><p>Story: Ruben has shown how to functionally describe REST services. Here's the brief version:</p></font>

<p>
All services that we consider in this document feature Web APIs that are modeled according to the REST principles. While their protocol semantics are thus specified (e.g., by HTTP), we define their high-level domain semantics (i.e., which function a service can perform) using <a href="http://restdesc.org/">RESTdesc</a>, a machine-interpretable functional service description format for REST APIs. RESTdesc descriptions are expressed in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/">Notation3</a> (N3), an RDF superset that adds support for quantification. As for RDF/XML, the basic unit in N3 is the <em>triple</em> that is expressed in the format "<em>Subject Predicate Object.</em>"  RESTdesc descriptions are regular N3 implications and can be applied by any N3 reasoner without requiring special support. As an example to illustrate the main RESTdesc concepts, the following description of a Celsius-to-Fahrenheit converter communicates how the service can convert a Celsius temperature to the equivalent Fahrenheit temperature:
</p>

<p><div class="example"><pre>
@prefix dbpedia: &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/#&gt;.
@prefix ex: &lt;http://example.org/#&gt;.
@prefix http: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2011/http#&gt;.

{
  ?tempC a dbpedia:Temperature; ex:hasValue ?cVal; ex:hasUnit "Celsius".
}
=&gt;
{
  _:tempF a dbpedia:Temperature; ex:hasValue ?fVal; ex:hasUnit "Fahrenheit"; owl:sameAs ?tempC.
<!-- modeled as an action result
  _:request http:methodName "POST"; http:requestURI "converter.example.com/cel2degf"; http:reqBody ?cVal; http:resp [ http:body ?fVal ].
 modeled as a cacheable lookup -->
  _:request http:methodName "GET"; http:requestURI ("lookup.example.com/cel2degf?temp=" ?cVal); http:resp [ http:body ?fVal ].
}.
</pre></div></p>

<p>
At the highest level, a RESTdesc description consists of three parts: preconditions, postconditions, and a RESTful request that realizes the postconditions from the preconditions. In the above example, the preconditions ("?tempC...") stipulate that a certain temperature expressed in degrees Celsius exists, and that this temperature has a specific value. The postconditions ("_:tempF...") warrant that there exists a temperature expressed in degrees Fahrenheit that is the same as the Celsius temperature. Finally, the HTTP request ("_:request...") is a POST request to a URI that accepts the Celcius value in the request body and returns the Fahrenheit value in the response body. This HTTP request is described by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/HTTP-in-RDF10/">HTTP in RDF</a> vocabulary. In this example, the method name, request URI, and the body of the response are specified. When multiple predicate-object pairs are separated using semicolons, all of these pairs are associated to the leading subject. Note how N3 adds formulas (between curly braces) that group together triples, variables (starting with a question mark), and implications (triples where the predicate is "=>"). The <em>@prefix</em> declarations indicate which ontologies are used within the document.
</p>

<p>
Given a reasoner that has access to the service description of the temperature converter, users can now formulate a goal to ask which Fahrenheit temperature is equivalent to 20&deg;C:
</p>

<p><div class="example"><pre>
:myTemp a dbpedia:Temperature; ex:hasValue "20"; ex:hasUnit "Celsius".

_:convTemp ex:hasValue ?value; ex:hasUnit "Fahrenheit"; ex:sameAs :myTemp.
</pre></div></p>

<p>
From this goal, a reasoner can instantiate the temperature conversion description that will indicate that the answer is given in the response body of an HTTP POST request to <em>http://converter.example.com/cel2degf</em>. When a reasoner has access to multiple rules, it can <em>chain the implications</em> they contain and thereby find out how the client must coordinate invocations of different services that can <em>together</em> achieve the user goal. For instance, if the user wants to set a temperature of 20&deg;C in an environment that contains a smart thermostat that can only take inputs in degrees Fahrenheit, the reasoner will instruct it to first send an HTTP GET to the converter service, unpack the response body, and send the obtained temperature value (in degrees Fahrenheit) to the thermostat. The combination of RESTdesc descriptions with reasoning thus yields a powerful service composition mechanism. 
</p>


</div><h2 id="iotsemantics">2.2 Describing Functionalities of WoT Devices</h2><div>
<font color="red"><p>Story: With a tweak, this works for WoT Scenarios as well</p></font>

<p>
The main issue when applying RESTdesc in WoT scenarios is that RESTdesc &mdash; being grounded in first-order logic &mdash; is not able to distinguish between mutually exclusive states of devices and their services. Therefore, while RESTdesc works very well for describing services that do not induce incompatible states such as the temperature converter in the previous example, already the most basic use cases that involve <em>stateful</em> objects cause problems regarding the soundness of the reasoning. As an example, assume that the system has access to the fact that a room has a temperature of 23&deg;C and the user sets the same room to 22&deg;C. This introduces a logical contradiction because the room cannot have two different temperatures at the same moment. We therefore propose an extension to RESTdesc that incorporates a mechanism that allows to explicitly describe states, in our case of smart environments and of the devices they contain. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of state transitions to enable the annotation of services that induce state changes. Consider the following RESTdesc description of a smart thermostat:
</p>

<p><div class="example"><pre>
{
  ?newTemp a ex:Temperature; ex:hasValue ?fVal; ex:hasUnit "Fahrenheit".
  ?thermostat a dbpedia:Thermostat; geonames:locatedIn ?place.
  ?state a st:State.
}
=&gt;
{
  [ a st:StateChange; st:replaced { ?place ex:hasTemperature ?newTemp. }; st:parent ?state ].
  
  _:request http:methodName "PUT"; http:requestURI (?thermostat); http:reqBody ?fVal.
}.
</pre></div></p>

<p>
From the antecedent of this rule, we can see that an execution of the service requires a temperature value in degrees Fahrenheit ("?newTemp...") as well as the presence of a device of type <em>Thermostat</em> at a specific location ("?thermostat..."). The preconditions furthermore contain a state description that holds the ambient temperature at the location of the thermostat ("?state..."). From the consequent of the rule, we learn that an HTTP PUT request to the thermostat ("_:request...") will result in a state transition: the new state includes the fact that the temperature at the location of the thermostat is <em>?newTemp</em>. The semantics of state transitions are described in a publicly available <a href="http://notes.restdesc.org/2013/states.n3">states ontology</a> that can be looked up by reasoners for successful state handling. That document defines, for instance, the meaning of the "st:replaced" property: in the above example, all "ex:hasTemperature" relations of "?place" in a parent state ("?state") are replaced with the new object ("?newTemp"). The replace transition also covers the case when no previous state is defined in the descriptions.
</p>

<p>
Given the above functional description, a user can now set the ambient temperature at a specific location (http://example.org/Office) to 23&deg;C by formulating the following goal:
</p>

<p><div class="example"><pre>
:temp23 a ex:Temperature; ex:hasValue "23"; ex:hasUnit "Celsius".

?state a st:State; log:includes { http://example.org/Office ex:hasTemperature :temp23. }.
</pre></div></p>

<p>
In this goal, the user first defines the <em>temp23</em> constant that includes the desired temperature value in degrees Celsius. This entity is then used when defining the desired state of the location <em>Office</em>. This goal can be sent to a reasoner that will, in response, indicate that the goal state can be reached by first sending an HTTP GET request to the converter service to obtain the corresponding Fahrenheit value, and then send an HTTP PUT request to the URI of the thermostat at the location <em>http://example.org/Office</em> (given that it knows about that device). The URI of that thermostat is found at runtime because the functional service description shown before contains the precondition that the thermostat must be located at the correct location.
</p>



</div><hr><h1 id="constrained">3. Integration with Constrained Environments</h1>
<font color="red"><p>Story: Above, we use HTTP calls as examples. However, the WoT also involves lots of resource-constrained devices. Here's how we talk to these. And there's also a discovery mechanism with CoRE LF and RD. We'll use this later</p></font>
  
<p><font color="red">Matthias, could you take care of connecting this part more to the rest of the contribution? For the Push notifications: I think we should remove that part if we don't use it anywhere else. If we keep it, we should refer to it from the 2nd paragraph of <a href="#discovery">Section 4</a> (Simon)</font></p>

<p><font color="red">I think we need some restructuring for this (see e-mail). (Matthias)</font></p>

<p>
A large number of IoT devices is expected to be resource-constrained. These devices usually connect wirelessly over low-power Wi-Fi or <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4944">6LoWPAN</a>. For the application layer, the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/core">Constrained RESTful Environments</a> (CoRE) working group at the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a> is defining a complete framework for resource-oriented IoT applications. At its center is the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252">Constrained Application Protocol</a> (CoAP), a RESTful protocol that allows for seamless integration of constrained IoT Devices into the Web. Like HTTP, CoAP uses URIs to address resources (using the <code>coap</code> scheme), Internet Media Types to transfer their state, and the powerful mechanisms for content negotiation and cache control. It supports the four basic methods GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and response codes that were refined for machine-to-machine communication (e.g., explicit "Created", "Changed", and "Deleted" codes). Furthermore, CoAP is a compact binary protocol with low parsing complexity. It uses a datagram transport, that is, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc768">UDP</a> or <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347">DTLS</a>. Using a CoAP-HTTP cross-proxy, requests and responses can be translated transparently between the two RESTful protocols. Yet there are further components in the CoRE framework to build an IoT ecosystem. 
</p>


<h2 id="corelinkformat">3.1 CoRE Link Format</h2><div>

<p>
The <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6690">CoRE Link Format</a> extends <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988">Web Linking</a> for IoT service discovery. The RFC defines an Internet Media Type (<code>application/link-format</code>) that allows to transfer a list of Web links together with link parameters such as relation-types or the supported content formats (media type together with encoding). Devices implementing the specification must provide a <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5785">well-known resource</a> for CoRE resource discovery at <code>/.well-known/core</code>. This way, other IoT devices can query the hosted of resource, either the complete list or filtered by attributes. For CoAP, this mechanism also works over IP multicast: Devices can send a GET request to the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252#section-12.8"><code>all-coap-nodes</code></a> multicast address to discover CoAP servers and directly filter for intended resources.
</p>

<p>
The CoRE Link Format can be used to discover the resources that provide the semantic device descriptions through a registered resource type attribute (e.g., <code>rt="w3c.n3"</code>). This way, the reasoner can directly query for all the device descriptions in its environment. 
</p>


</div><h2 id="coredirectory">3.2 CoRE Resource Directory</h2><div>

<p>
In constrained environments, IoT devices might not be reachable all the time. Extensive multicast traffic als has negative impact on battery lifetimes. Thus, typical CoRE deployments make use of a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-resource-directory-02">resource directory</a> (RD). There, IoT devices register their CoRE Link Format after booting and joining the network, which enables other devices and services to efficiently discover them through the RD lookup interface. The RD address can either be configured during commissioning or discovered through a single multicast request when joining a new network. Devices also define a lifetime after which the registration will be dropped. To confirm availability, devices need to update their registration before this timeout. The update mechanism can also be used to inform the RD about new resource (e.g., because a new dynamic resource was created or a new sensor was plugged into a modular device). If devices leave the network before their lifetime expires, they can also explicitly de-register.
</p>


</div><h2 id="corepush">3.3 Push Notifications</h2><div>
  
<font color="red">
<p>
I will keep it in for future versions of this document where we might need it ;). Will align after decision on restructuring. (Matthias)
</p></font>

<p>
CoAP furthermore features a protocol extension that enables <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-observe-16">Observing Resources in CoAP</a>. By adding the <code>Observe</code> option to a GET request, client can signal the server that it wants to be informed about future state changes of the resource. When the option is supported by the server, it will reply with an <code>Observe</code> in the response. This turns the response into a notification and represents a promise that the server will push further notifications when the resource state changes. The mechanism relies on eventual consistency: all observers of a resource will eventually recieve the latest state of the resource at the origin server. This means that individual changes might be lost, either because of the lossiness of constrained networks or because of a debouncing process at the server when the resource changes too frequently. Hence, all updates need to be modelled as state and not as events. A door bell, for instance, would be modelled as a counter or a timestamp of the last press event---and not as a constant "pressed" event. The observe extension enables push notification for constrained RESTful environments and takes potential losses of real-world IoT systems into account at a conceptual level.
</p>


  
</div><hr><h1 id="discovery">4. Discovering Functional Semantic Metadata</h1>

<font color="red"><p>Story: The stuff needs to be discovered. We can use Web Linking for that. In CoAP, we get to use the cool CoRE RD stuff</p></font>

<p>
To be able to create service mashups on top of the proposed approach, a system must have access to a means of discovering the individual services that are available in the current environment, as well as their functional descriptions. Given device URLs, we propose to enable the automated discovery of their functional descriptions using <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988">Web Linking</a> headers as part of service responses to REST requests (i.e., responses to GET and OPTIONS requests in an HTTP environment). In this way, the N3 descriptions that a device links to for describing its capabilities can be stored physically on the device or at a remote location where they are accessed and parsed by interested clients. For resource-constrained devices, the same functionality is provided via the CoRE Link Format, as described above. Additionally, clients in this domain can use a CoRE Resource Directory to discover the device URLs. In HTTP environments, different mechanisms can be used for obtaining this information, for instance proximity-based technologies (e.g., NFC, QR codes, BLE), local network discovery (e.g., UPnP, mDNS), or service directories.
</p>

<font color="red"><p>Story: This is how the entire thing now works together</p></font>

<p>
In our prototype implementation, the complete process works as follows: To access the individual service descriptions, our reasoner first does a look-up to find service entry URIs, using a special search engine or a CoRE Resource Directory. It then accesses these URIs, follows the returned Web Linking / Link Format links, and parses the N3 documents at these locations, thereby creating a local service catalog. The reasoner also leverages the CoRE RD to keep track of all available devices in a way that is friendly for resource-constrained devices and networks and updates its service catalogue whenever it discovers a new link to an N3 description. Now, whenever a client asks for a certain goal, the reasoner is invoked with the service descriptions from that catalog and the goal and searches for a path from the current state to the goal state. If successful, it returns the necessary requests to realize the goal &mdash; to do this, we use a proprietary format of conveying a list of REST requests (see <a href="#issues">Section 6</a>). The client then executes these requests to realize its goal.
</p>



<hr><h1 id="usecases">5. Use Cases</h1>

<p>
This document describes how RESTdesc functional service descriptions can be used to describe any service that induces state transitions, and specifically to model smart environments in IoT scenarios. Our approach opens up a range of possibilities for automated service composition not only in the user's private home but also in an office environment, in hotel rooms, cars, and potentially also in public places (see <a href="smarthome">Section 5.1</a>). In an industrial context, machines or assembly lines could automatically adjust to support their current operator, and semantics could assist the rapid reconfiguration of manufacturing systems (see <a href="smartmanufacturing">Section 5.2</a>). Finally, such a system could be helpful in medical environments, for instance to increase the oxygen saturation to aid asthmatics, or could automatically configure monitor systems to support doctors during clinical diagnostics.
</p>


<h2 id="smarthome">5.1 An Assistant for Configuring Smart Environments</h2><div>

<p>
A scenario that demonstrates the applicability of the proposed system in smart home environments is an application that automatically modifies smart environments to match end-user preferences. Using a handheld or wearable device such as a tablet computer, smartphone, or smartwatch, users can specify the song or radio station to be played in their environment and their comfort temperature, set ambient alarms in the environment, or adjust the lighting to match their preferred levels. This device then negotiates with the environment to adjust the specified parameters to the user's comfort settings and can also provide feedback to the user about whether the negotiations were successful. Given that devices are properly described and discoverable, the proposed approach enables this application to operate successfully in arbitrary environments, that is, not only in the user's private home but also in an office environment, in hotel rooms, cars, and potentially also in public places. 
</p>

This use case involves discoverable smart devices with proper service descriptions, a reasoner that can consume their functional descriptions and the user's goals, and a user interface (e.g., a smartphone or a Web application) that allows the user to configure his smart environment. Given a desired setting, the user interface is responsible of creating a user goal, sending it to the reasoner, and executing the requests that are proposed by the reasoner.

<p>
In an industrial context, machines or assembly lines could automatically adjust to support their current operator, and semantics could assist the rapid reconfiguration of manufacturing systems. For instance, communicating manufacturing robots, conveyor belts, and other machines in a manufacturing environment can use the approach described here to plan how exactly a workable item should be processed. This would permit to automatically reconfigure the manufacturing process if a device becomes unavailable or if new devices should be integrated in the process. It would also allow dynamically reacting to changes in non-functional parameters of the production process: for instance, the process could automatically change to accomodate goals such as "produce this part as quickly as possible" or "produce that part with as few CO2 emissions as possible."

Similar to the first use case, this scenario involves discoverable smart devices with service descriptions, a reasoner, and a configuration and monitoring interface.

</div><hr><h1 id="issues">6. Open Issues</h1>

We see the following immediate open issues before the discussed approach can be deployed more broadly:

<p><ol>
<li>A standard (and concise) <em>media type for REST execution plans</em>: our implementation uses a custom format for transmitting execution plans between the reasoner and its clients. Rather, it should be using a standard format for such plans, which could be based on the HTTP ontology.</li>

<li>Agreed-upon <em>Web Linking relation types for the semantic descriptions</em></li>
</ol></p>
